# Reinteractive Code Test by Nimrod Evans

Hi Joelle. Here's my somewhat over the top code challenge.

## Getting Started
Just download the repo to take a look. I've included the dist so you don't have to compile anything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shraka/reint-codetest.git
```

### Compiling
You should need to do this, but if you want to compile the project you'll need NPM.
Note that I haven't included a server, or any tests. 

### Installing

```bash
npm install
```

### Compiling
This outputs to the build/ folder

```bash
gulp build
```

### Watch function
Automatically outputs build/ folder

```bash
gulp watch
```

### Release function
Outputs to the dist/ folder for distribution

```bash
gulp release
```

When prompted, press 'Y'

That's all.
